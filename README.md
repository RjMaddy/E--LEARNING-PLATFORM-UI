## 📝 Project Overview

The *E-Learning Platform UI* is a responsive web interface designed to simulate the look and feel of an online education system. It includes essential components such as course listings, embedded video lessons, user progress tracking UI, and a clean dashboard layout.

This project was built using only *HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript*, demonstrating frontend development skills without the use of frameworks. The design ensures usability across both desktop and mobile devices with responsive layouts using CSS Flexbox and Grid systems.

The homepage features a *course catalog* where users can view available courses, each with a title, thumbnail, and brief description. Clicking on a course leads to a *course detail page* where an embedded video player allows users to watch lessons directly within the interface using <iframe> (e.g., YouTube or hosted videos).

A *user progress section* displays course completion status using visually styled progress bars. These dynamically update based on JavaScript variables representing completed modules or lessons. Users can also see how many videos they’ve watched or how far they’ve advanced in a course.

The platform includes a *sidebar navigation menu, a **search bar* to filter courses, and *categories/tags* for easier content discovery. All buttons, links, and menus are styled using custom CSS and include hover animations and transitions for a modern, engaging UI.

The project structure is modular: HTML files are cleanly separated, CSS is written in external stylesheets, and all interactivity is handled in JS. The UI is fully customizable and can serve as a base for further backend integration (like adding databases or login systems in the future).
